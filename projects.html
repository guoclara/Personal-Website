                Brown Outing Club Weighted Lottery System
            </h6>
            <p>
              Full stack development for Brown University's Outing Club. Users with a brown.edu email are able to register/log in 
              and enter lotteries for upcoming trips they want to go on. Each user is weighted based on a variety of variables 
              (e.g. if they won a trip slot prior, if they are a first timer, etc). There is an administrative page 
              that allows authorized users to run lotteries; reset weights; and view, create, edit, and delete rows in the database 
              tables. The lottery results are displayed in admin as well, and emails are sent out once results are calculated.

              <h6>Search</h6>
              <p>
                  Search engine comprised of an Indexer and Querier that processes thousands of XML files from Wikipedia. 
                  Calculates word document frequency, inverse document frequency, and 
                  page rank to process queries and quickly produce the top 10 most 
                  relevant results. The Indexer portion parses files, condenses files into 
                  essential terms, records links, and calculates relvate parameters. The Querier processes the query from the user 
                  and calculates the relvance score of each document and prints the 10 highest scoring documents if available. 
                  Users have the option to include page rank (i.e. the authority of pages, a technique pioneered by Google) in the score.

                will be rejected or accepted for a position. New Object = Applicant. Hirability = Attribute).
                The user can select any attribute to look up a recommendation for.

                Interpreter that takes in a program written in Racket as a string and processes it in ML
                to produce results. It handles definitions, conditionals, logic, let expressions,
                procedure-application expressions, anonymous functions, and nesting. The interpreter is split into 
                components that parse, evaluate, and converts the result back into a string.
