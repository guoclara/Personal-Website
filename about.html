        Hi! I'm Clara Guo.
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a sophomore studying Applied Math-Computer Science at Brown Univeristy.
        I'm extremely passionate about understanding how to take data and information in the world and
        making it easier for everyone to understand. I think it's especially important to do this work
        with the intent of pushing forward social change driven by evidence. I want to be part of that change.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life, I came across this article describing a 
        North Carolina gerrymandering court case. At the hearing, math professors were called to testify on the likelihood 
        that the majority party gerrymandered their voting districts and they were able to provide hard evidence arguing that it 
        was nearly certain they had. After that day, I understood the power that STEM can have in our society and community. And 
        I decided I wanted to do something similar.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I'm driven by this desire and it translates to what I do and how I do it. I'm someone who thinks
        on their feet and isn't afraid of failing. I'm proactive, self-motivated, creative and collaborative. I'm able to 
        practice this in my academic career as well as my hobbies, some of which include playing soccer, cooking, and whittling. 
        I always want to learn more, whether that means teaching myself how to carve block prints or learning html to make this website.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Take a look at the rest of the website, and please contact me if you have any questions!
        My socials and email can be found on the bottom right of the home page, and my resume in the top right.
